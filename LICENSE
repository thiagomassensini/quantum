THEORY "HORIZONTE -1" - QUANTUM RELATIVITY UNIFICATION
======================================================

This repository contains the revolutionary "Horizonte -1" theory that unifies 
General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics through the principle that quantum 
phenomena occur in regions where spacetime information "almost cannot escape."

Key Discoveries:
- Apparent superluminal quantum velocities explained by extreme spacetime folding
- Nuclear decay processes as information release from confined curvature
- Quark confinement via "Horizonte -1" regions
- Complete unification across all energy scales (Planck to Molecular)

The mathematical framework, computational implementations, and theoretical 
foundations are made available for scientific research and educational purposes.
