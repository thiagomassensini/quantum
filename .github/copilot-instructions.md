# Quantum Relativity Unification Project - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a theoretical physics research project exploring the unification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics through Einstein's equivalence principle. The core hypothesis suggests that quantum phenomena may be explained by extreme spacetime curvature effects at microscopic scales.

## Key Concepts & Architecture
- **Core Theory**: Observer-observed relationships in quantum mechanics mirror relativistic reference frame effects
- **Main Scenarios**: Cosmonauts near black holes vs. Earth observers as analogies for quantum particle behavior
- **Project Goal**: Demonstrate that apparent "faster than light" quantum effects are actually spacetime folding

## Development Workflows
- **Simulations**: Use numpy/scipy for numerical relativity calculations
- **Visualization**: matplotlib for spacetime diagrams and quantum state plots
- **Research**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive theory exploration
- **Testing**: pytest for validating physics equations and simulation accuracy

## Physics-Specific Conventions
- All spacetime calculations use natural units (c=1, G=1)
- Quantum states represented as complex numpy arrays
- Time dilation factors calculated using Schwarzschild metric
- Observer reference frames explicitly tracked in all simulations

## Dependencies & Tools
- **Core**: numpy, scipy, matplotlib for scientific computing
- **Notebooks**: jupyter, ipywidgets for interactive research
- **Physics**: sympy for symbolic mathematics, astropy for cosmological constants
- **Visualization**: plotly for 3D spacetime visualizations
